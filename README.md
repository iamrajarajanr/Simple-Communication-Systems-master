# Simple Communication Systems

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of simple communication systems implemented in MATLAB. Each system demonstrates fundamental concepts in communication theory and digital signal processing.

## Systems Included
1. **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: Implementation of basic AM modulation and demodulation.
2. **Frequency Modulation (FM)**: Implementation of basic FM modulation and demodulation.
3. **Phase Modulation (PM)**: Implementation of basic PM modulation and demodulation.
4. **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)**: Implementation of PAM using rectangular and sinc pulses.

## Requirements
- MATLAB

## Usage
Each system is implemented in its own Python script (`am_modulation.m`, `fm_modulation.m`, etc.). To run a specific system:
```bash
MATLAB am_modulation.m
